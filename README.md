# Forecasting Brent Crude Oil Prices

## Description:

Practice with the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model with a focus on physical energy commodities. 

In this project, I am interested in experimenting with LSTMs as their ability to handle sequential data allows them to analyse long-term dependencies between time steps of data. I am also interested in comparing LSTM vs other models.

This project is inspired by this [article](https://medium.com/@vinayarun/from-scratch-an-lstm-model-to-predict-commodity-prices-179e12445c5a) on forecasting commodity prices using an LSTM model.
